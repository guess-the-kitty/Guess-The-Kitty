  <h2>What Is Guess the Kitty?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Guess the Kitty</strong> is a fun and slightly twisted quiz game where you try to figure out what kind of cat you're looking at. Sounds simple, right? Think again. Each round shows you a strange or funny cat, and you have to pick the right answer from three choices.
  </p>
  <p>
    But here’s the catch—get it wrong, and the poor kitty might not have such a happy ending. That’s part of what makes the game so memorable: it mixes cute cats with unexpected consequences.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Play</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Look at the cat image on screen</li>
    <li>Choose the answer you think is correct</li>
    <li>Watch what happens based on your choice</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    There’s no complicated setup—just tap and guess. The game is short, fast-paced, and keeps you guessing (literally).
  </p>

  <h2>Tips to Win</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pay attention to details</strong> – Accessories or backgrounds might hint at the answer</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t rush</strong> – Sometimes the oddest answer is actually the right one</li>
    <li><strong>Play a few times</strong> – You’ll start to remember which cats go with which roles</li>
    <li><strong>Enjoy the surprise</strong> – Even the wrong answers are part of the fun</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Play Guess the Kitty?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>It’s super easy to get into—no rules, no learning curve</li>
    <li>The mix of humor and shock value keeps it fresh</li>
    <li>Great for quick breaks or sharing laughs with friends</li>
    <li>If you love cats, you'll enjoy the weird and wild variety this game offers</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Guess the Kitty</strong> is short, silly, and surprisingly addictive. It’s the kind of game that doesn’t take itself seriously—but that’s exactly the charm. You’re not just guessing for points—you’re guessing to see what hilarious (or horrifying) thing happens next.
  </p>
  <p>
    Try it once, and you'll probably end up clicking “play again” more than you'd expect.
